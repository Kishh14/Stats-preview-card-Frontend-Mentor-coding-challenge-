### What I learned
While creating this project
i learned how to create a card in css and how to display it properly.

I learned how to design a
css card along with i have learned to position all of the content in a css card.

### Continued development
I think i need to practice more css, because i want to improve my css flexbox and css grid concepts, as they are very important to create layouts. 

### Useful resources
- [1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter ) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand css filter property. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
